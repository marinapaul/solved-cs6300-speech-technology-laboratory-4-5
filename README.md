 <li>Extract formants, and plot the formant contours.</li>

 <li>Perform VAD using zero crossing rate and short-term energy.</li>

 <li>Extract pitch using autocorrelation method or cepstrum method after performing VAD.</li>

 <li>Record a male and female voice for the sentence “We were away a yearago.” Compute the spectrogram, perform VAD, extract formants and pitch. Overlay the formant and pitch curves on the spectrogram.</li>
